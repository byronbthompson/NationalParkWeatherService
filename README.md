#### Disclaimer
This App was a capstone I built while in .NET bootcamp. The focus for this particular project was MVC5 so a lot of things like API calls for real weather updates and javascript/ JQuery hadn't been discussed yet. None the less I had fun making it and may flesh out some more features in the near future. 

#### Feel free to clone and fork.
It's pleasing to look, so Im told so I'm happy to share as a starting point for someone elses project.

## Enjoy!!!
